# Introductionto-Embedded-Systems-Software-and-Development-Environments

This repo contains my personal notes and programming assignments for the Coursera's "Introduction to embedded systems software and development environments" course by University of Colorado Boulder. The course is instructed by Eng. Alex Fosdick

The first week introdcues the embedded systems, software configuration management, C standardization, coding standards, documenting, and version control with git, the week assignment is to write a simple C program to do some operations on arrays, apply the learned topics on that code such as writing high quality, documented code as well as working with git    

Second week illustrates the full build process as well as working with makefiles, the week assignment is to write a makefile automating the whole building process for 2 different architectures, generating dependancy files as well as memory map file for the application.
    
Third week illustrates the memory types, segments, and subsegments used in embedded systems, the week assignment is to analyze a project with some GCC tools like objdump and nm as well as the memory map file and determine each variable is stored in which segement and subsegment in memory.   

Fourth week is just an assignment that integrates all the learned topics throughout the course.
